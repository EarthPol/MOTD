# EarthPol MOTD Collection

This repository is dedicated to building a diverse collection of Minecraft Server Messages of the Day (MOTDs) specifically for EarthPol. The MOTD is the first thing players see on the multiplayer page before they join the server, and we aim to create a shared resource of creative, funny, and engaging MOTDs that reflect the spirit of our community.

## How to Contribute:
- Submit your own MOTD ideas by opening a pull request.
- Use color codes and formatting to make your MOTDs stand out.
- Share your favorite quotes, welcome messages, or fun messages for EarthPol players.
- Help build a community-driven collection of MOTDs for EarthPol!

Everyone in the EarthPol community is welcome to contribute, and all submissions will be reviewed for creativity and usability. Letâ€™s create a collection that gives players a great first impression of EarthPol every time they see our server on the multiplayer screen!
