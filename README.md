# Community MOTD Collection

This repository is dedicated to building a diverse collection of Minecraft Server Messages of the Day (MOTDs) contributed by the community. The MOTD is the first thing players see before joining a server, and we aim to create an extensive, shared resource of creative, funny, and engaging MOTDs for everyone to use.

## How to Contribute:
- Submit your own MOTD ideas by opening a pull request.
- Use color codes and formatting to make your MOTDs stand out.
- Share your favorite quotes, welcome messages, or server info snippets.
- Help build a community-driven collection for servers of all types!

Everyone is welcome to contribute, and all submissions will be reviewed for creativity and usability. Letâ€™s create the ultimate resource for Minecraft servers together!
